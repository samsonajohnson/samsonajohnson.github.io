This is a blog of research notes that I hope someone (including myself) will find useful. 
Inspired by [David Hogg's](link), I used to keep a local research/work log. Now that I have a website, I'm gonna put it online (probably to my poor judgement).

A few recent posts are below, and the archive is [here](link). I love talking about science, so please ask questions or point cool things out to me!

This is a page about my research. Enjoy!

#WFIRST

They main focus of my work has been predictions for the WFIRST micorlensing survey. I am about to publish a paper on what WFIRST can help us learn about the frequency of free-floating planets. I am working on what WFIRST will tell us about the frequency of Earth-analog systems. 

In conjuction, I am working on a modular Galactic population-synthesis model with an OSU undergraduate. This model is meant to be public and easily customizable. This will be publically available soon. 

I also spent the summer of 2019 working on making an extinction map towards the Galactic bulge using UKIRT data. This is another work in progress, related to WFIRST.

#MINERVA

Here is blurb on MINERVA.

#SUPERNOVAE

I have done research on supernovae, as well. Using Large Binocular Telescope data, I worked with Chris Kochanek on extracting photometry of supernovae progenitors in the final years before the exploded. We were able to place constraints on their brightness variations.

### [*Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman)*](./research-pages/romanst.md)

They main focus of my work over the past two years has been on predictions for the [*Roman*](https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/) Galactic Exoplanet Surevy. Microlensing searches for exoplanets are sensitive to those in wider orbits (1-10 times that of the Earth's orbit). It is senstive to the mass-ratio of the planet and the star, so extra observations are required to obtain a true mass of the planet. This will be the first space-based microlensing survey, and it promises to 'complete the exoplanet census', or at least be a great compliment to the *Kepler* survey. 

### [MINERVA](./research-pages/minerva.md)

During my undergrad and a break year, I worked with the MINature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array ([MINERVA](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/minerva/)). The observatory is aimed to search for exoplanets using the radial velocity (RV) technique. I worked on a lot of the automation and operation of the robotic observatory, and learned a lot about instrumentation in astronomy. 

### [SUPERNOVAE PROGENITORS](./research-pages/supernovae-progenitors.md)

I have done research on supernovae, as well. Using [Large Binocular Telescope](https://www.lbto.org/) data, I worked with [Chris Kochanek](https://astronomy.osu.edu/people/kochanek.1) on extracting photometry of supernovae progenitors in the final years before the exploded. We were able to place constraints on their brightness variations.

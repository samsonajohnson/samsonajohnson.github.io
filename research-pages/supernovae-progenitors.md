title: Work on Supernovae Progenitors

# {{page.title}}

I have done research on supernovae, as well. Using Large Binocular Telescope data, I worked with Chris Kochanek on extracting photometry of supernovae progenitors in the final years before the exploded. We were able to place constraints on their brightness variations.

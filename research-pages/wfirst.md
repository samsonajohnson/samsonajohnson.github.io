They main focus of my work has been predictions for the WFIRST micorlensing survey. I am about to publish a paper on what WFIRST can help us learn about the frequency of free-floating planets. I am working on what WFIRST will tell us about the frequency of Earth-analog systems. 

In conjuction, I am working on a modular Galactic population-synthesis model with an OSU undergraduate. This model is meant to be public and easily customizable. This will be publically available soon. 

I also spent the summer of 2019 working on making an extinction map towards the Galactic bulge using UKIRT data. This is another work in progress, related to WFIRST.

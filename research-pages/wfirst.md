title: *Roman* Galactic Exoplanet Survey

# {{page.title}}

They main focus of my work has been predictions for the *Roman* Galactic Exoplanet Survey. I recently put out a paper on what *Roman* can help us learn about the frequency of free-floating planets. I am working on what *Roman* will tell us about the frequency of Earth-analog systems.

The above plot shows the 95% confidence limit *Roman* will be able to place on populations of free-floating planetary mass objects in the Milky Way if it makes no detections. Think of the vertical axis as $$M_p dN/d\log{M_p}$$. This value sits well below the current best limits, and will test many predictions from planet formation (the gray markers). For information, see the recent paper [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200610760J/abstract).

In conjuction, I am working on a modular Galactic population-synthesis model with an OSU undergraduate. This model is meant to be public and easily customizable. This will be publically available soon. 

I also spent the summer of 2019 working on making an extinction map towards the Galactic bulge using UKIRT data. This is another work in progress, related to WFIRST.

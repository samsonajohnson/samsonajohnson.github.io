# {{page.title}}

MINERVA (the MINiature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array) is an array of four 0.7meter telescopes searching for exoplanets using the radial velocity technique. I worked on the dispatch scheduling alghorithm for the array during my undergrad at the University of Montana with Nate McCrady. I also worked to help automate the robotic observatory, and wrote a lot of the control software with [Jason Eastman](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~jeastman/) from 2015-2016 between undergrad and grad scool at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I helped with the installation of the spectrograph, and spend around 9 weeks total at the Fred Lawernce Whipple Observatory.

Here is a link to the [MINERVA control software Github repository](https://github.com/MinervaCollaboration/minerva-control/tree/master). There is a ton here, from routines for controllling the telescopes and imagers to down to the power distribution units (PDUs).

No more China visit. 

<!--more-->

The coronavirus has caused quite the stir, and I have decided to redact my plans to go the the 24th annual microlensing conference in Beijing. This came shortly before the university sent out an email restricting all university-funded travel to China. So, hopefully that will be rescheduled for October this year. In more conference news, I am going to the WFIRS Science Jamnoree in early march, and have registered for Exoplanets III in July.

Yesterday was the URSA facilitators meeting, where we discussed the plan and schedule for the fall. Over the two weeks, we are going to discuss the transit and radial velocity method of discovering exoplanets. This is to be a frame work to actually teach the students about university life, research, and learning techniques that will aid them in their undergraduate careers. I am very excited about the program. I will have to do my shar earlier rather than later, as July is only getting busier for me.

Okay, so a bit more automotation has been put in blogging. M51 has nebular H_alpha 30 kpc away

<!--more-->

Today at coffee, saw some pics of nebular emission H_alpha clouds provided by CCAPP speaker, around M51. Also learned M51 is an AGN (seyfert II)? Spent the rest of my morning figuring out visa stuff for China, will hopefully send that off on my way home today. I just want to hear back from Damita. I also looked at a few houses for Cat and I to rent. Not as grim as I thought, but we need to act fast. 

Chrome will not let you exclude history from search suggestions, and it is so annoying. I wish it would just suggest bookmarks.

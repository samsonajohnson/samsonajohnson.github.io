Back from vacation, getting on the horse.

<!--more-->

I had an amazing week in Hawaii. I got to see so much, and it was fantastic to spend time with family.

Back onto work, I'm running more eta earth simulations. I wrote more of the thesis proposal, and Chris Kochanek agreed to be on it. I'm currently planning for that in middle March (maybe the Ides for good measure).

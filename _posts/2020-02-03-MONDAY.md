Strangeness in extinction laws. Talked with Scott on persistence.

<!--more-->

Today was interesting at coffee, I read about [planet radius gap in K2 data](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200111511H/abstract), but I need ot get more in deoth on it. I spoke to Scott on the persitence stuff, need to revisit Long et al 2013 about the behavior/origin of the law. 

Also got the extinction law worked into the galactic model. Super stoked on that actually ,still need ot test it out though. Still a lot to do on it though.

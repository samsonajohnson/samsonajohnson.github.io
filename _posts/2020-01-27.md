Made a plot of the impact of persistence. Can't remember coffee.

<!--more-->

Wrote a long email this morning about to a few microsit people on Chris Hirata's group and their work on the sensor chip arrays. Also produced a few plots of my own on the impact of persistence (I hope). I put them below, or will try to? Let me figure that out later. I am meeting with A. Aronica today, talk about the Galactic model. I got a bit of code to grab extinction for sightlines using the Marshall 2006 maps. 

I also found some nice links summarizing exoplanet detection via radial velocities and transits:

[good NASA overview](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/ways-to-find-a-planet)
[More in depth on transits](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~avanderb/tutorial/tutorial.html)
[Nice summary from LCO](https://lco.global/spacebook/exoplanets/transit-method/)
And a good [link](https://www.universetoday.com/138014/radial-velocity-method/) on RVs, actually hard to find a good summary, could be worth writing one?

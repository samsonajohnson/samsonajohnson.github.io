David Will rememberence. Galactic model not looking so hot.

<!--more-->

David Will's rememberence was extremely hard. 

I spoke with Matthew, and the Galactic model distributions aren't actually that bad. It looks like the bulge is the most off, but these have two differing density laws. The stars evolution is off, so I am going to figure that out. I was using gyrs, not years. Looking even better.

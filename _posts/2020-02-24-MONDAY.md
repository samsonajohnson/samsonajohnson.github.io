Okay, blogging really fell off, but not this week. NYC and DC coming up fast.

<!--more-->

Just started some more eta earth simulations. These are nearing completion, and I have some solid plots for the talk next week. Going to speak with Scott on them this afternoon. Need to write up some more for agenda with Scott. 

Constructive time with Scott, might be skipping the Russia summer school. We talked about habitable zones, where the flux from a host star could maintain liquid water on an earth-like planet. I am trying to prep plots for the NYC meeting, and these numbers are pretty integral. 

Tomorrow my main goal will be working on the 2D recovery fraction plots. 

I spent some of yesterday (sunday) planning out weeks until job season. There is ~30 weeks, crazy.

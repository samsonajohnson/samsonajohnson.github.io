Ran coffee today, learned about WFI detectors yesterday.

Yesterday, I went to the WFIRST weak-lensing group where we heard about the tests they have done on the first three sensor chip arrays (SCAs) passed for flight. There is a 'jail bar' effect which could bias astrometry on the order of a few hundred microarcsecond. There was a lot of interesting stuff. I don't know how much I can talk about.

I just read a paper on a Gaia-Kepler stellar property catalog ([Berger et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07737)). The fit MIST isochrones to determine ages, as well as masses for stars in the Kepler survey to help improve the understanding of Kepler statistics.

Meeting with E. Kirby. Planet lunch.

<!--more-->

Decent meeting with E. kirby, not much learned. Width of metallicity distriubtion is a measure of mixing, makes sense. Planet lunch was good, heard about binary hosts, RM effect, more. I'm probably going to leave early to climb.

No one is signed up to make coffee. That's the way it goes.

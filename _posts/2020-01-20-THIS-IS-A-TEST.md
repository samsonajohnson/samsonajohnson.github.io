Learned about BBN, bulge metallicity. Wrote a quick script to make posts.

There was only four people at coffee today. Jennifer and David had a really interesting conversation on [Bensby et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200106222B/abstract). Basic gist, they take spectra of magnified source stars to measure their abundances. In this case, Lithium is examined in depth. Lithium is interesting because its abundance should be well predicted by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and it is also easily destroyed by stars. Its destruction comes from the fact that it burns at fairly low temperatures, so most stars fuse it right away and also for stars with large convective zones where it will get cycled through. F stars is the boundary where it won't be burned on the pre-main sequence. Also learned about the Spite Plateau, expectd Li abundance. Astaration is the destruction of elements by stars. Interesting lead if the deuterium abundance of local ISM is BBN levels but Li is enhanced. 

Talked with Scott about the FFP paper, going to omit the Fisher matrix analysis. Otherwise things are coming together for that paper. Also going to test if the assumption that the impact paramter less than one is valid. I think it is, but should be tested. We also are figuring out the visa situation for China, what a headache.

I looked into other website themes today, and there are some very cool ones. I will probably change soon.

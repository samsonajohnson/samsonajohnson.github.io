### Life
I'm oringally from Lolo, Montana. I went to Sentinel High School. I did my undergrad at University of Montana. It has a small physics program, but this is where I found my love for astronomy. I also did a lot of math there. 

### Rock Climbing
I spend a lot of my free time rock climbing. I usually climb at the OSU gym (OAC) or Vertical Adventures/Chambers in Columbus, Ohio. I have climbed at Red River Gorge and Mad River Gorge, and will be getting outside a lot more often.
